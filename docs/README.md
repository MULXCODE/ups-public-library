# About the Library

In addition to being a [searchable repository of information](/references/), this library contains a scaffolded catalog of [lessons](/learn/) and [exercises](/exercises/). Starting with foundational knowledge and working up to production web development practices, lessons build upon themselves. Most lessons are paired with exercises. If you feel you may know enough to skip to a certain part in the catalog, skipping through exercises until you find one that stumps you provides new information is a good way to find your starting place.
